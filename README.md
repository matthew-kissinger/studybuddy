# OpenAI Study Guide Creator

This Python script generates a study guide for a given topic using the OpenAI GPT API.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/matthew-kissinger/studybuddy.git`
2. Navigate to the repository: `cd studybuddy`
3. Install the required packages: `pip install openai`

## Usage

1. Run the script: `python studybuddy.py`
2. Enter your OpenAI API key when prompted.
3. Enter the topic you want to learn about.
4. Enter the number of hours you want to spend learning this topic.
5. Enter your experience level with this topic on a scale of 1-10.
6. Enter a file name to save the study guide to (without extension).
7. The script will generate a study guide and save it to a Markdown file with the specified file name.

## Output

The generated study guide will consist of a course overview and a number of parts, categories, or steps, depending on the topic and the user's inputs.

Each part, category, or step will be presented to the user one at a time. For each part, the user can choose to learn the next section or ask the GPT API for more information.

If the user chooses to ask the GPT API for more information, they will be prompted to enter an additional prompt to send to the API. The response from the API will be appended to the course material for that part and saved as a comment in the Markdown file.
